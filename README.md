A fun graphical adventure game

A dungeon is a network of tunnels and caves that are interconnected so that a player can explore the entire world by traveling from cave to cave through the tunnels that connect them. Each location in the dungeon represents a cell where a player can explore and can be connected to at most four (4) other locations: north, east, south, west. Each cell on the grid can either be a tunnel (2 entrances) or a cave (1, 3, 4 entrances). Caves carry treasures which the player can collect while exploring the dungeon. There are Otyughs present in the dungeon as well. A player entering a cave with an Otyugh that has not been slayed will be killed and eaten. To give the player the ability to slay the Otyugh, they will automatically be equipped with a bow that uses crooked arrows. It takes 2 hits to kill an Otyugh. Arrows are present throughout the dungeon for the player to pick up. The game can be played in either a text based adventure game or in a GUI. The GUI is used interactively where a user can move, pick, shoot or restart a game using mouse clicks and keyboard presses and the outcome being reflected on the view. Every 3 invalid moves made by a player makes a thief show up who will steal one of the treasures collected by the player.
